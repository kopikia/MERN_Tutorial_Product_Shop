Learn to build a full-stack web application using: MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js (MERN Stack)

Running the code in the terminal: npm run dev

After combining both backend and frontend, we do not need to run it seperately in 2 different terminal.
To successfully run this project, these are the steps to be taken:
1) Download the whole project folder
2) Open the terminal and ensure its at the root folder
3) Run: npm run build (it will install the dependencies for the backend and frontend; after which it will build the frontend application)
4) Once the build is successful, run: npm run start

To upload to github as a repo:
1) In the terminal, type: git init
2) Commit the changes
3) Copy the code for "push an exisiting repo from the command line" and paste into the terminal to upload

Hosting the server: render.com
